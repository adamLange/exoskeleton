#Motivation 

Electric skateboards, motorcycles ect are efficient, and economical means of transportation 
but would be better if crashing wasn't so hazardus to the human health.  I would like to achieve car-like speed and safety on an electric skateboard.  
I'd like to ride a motorcycle with odds of surviving a crash equal to or better than in a car. 
I would like to fly on a small electric, multi-rotor aircraft or strap turbojets on my back.  There are lots of really cool ways to get 
around to be developed.  A good first step is to get good at crashing.

#Features / Accessories

  - Joint locks 
     - The suit may allow the wearer of the suit to flex their joints or joint locks may be applied
       to prevent motion.  The locks may be any thing.  For example, elements may be arranged so that
       they are in contact with one an other.  The elements may be squeezed together by an actuator
       so that friction forces prevent motion.  When the actuator is un-applied and the wearer of 
       the suit moves their joints, the joint lock friction elements slide past one and other.
       When the actuators are applied the frictional forces between the sliding elements are higher.
  - Joint dampers
     - The suit may provide a force in opposition to the direction of movement.  The dampling elements
       may be the same elements as the joints locks.  A control system may be employed to modulate 
       the force applied to the friction producting elements in order to maintain a desired amount 
       of damping force during a joint movement.
       Eddy brakes could be used as a damping element.  Eddy brakes would
       have electromagnets or permanent magnets to generate an exciting force.
  - Air bags
    - For example, forearm mounted airbags could be built.  The airbags are normally
      stowed.  The airbags can be deployed by a pyrotechnic charge, compressed gas, ect.  When deployed
      , the airbags would be long cylinders parallel to the forarm.  The joint locks would prevent
      excessive movement of any of the wearers joints during deployment of the airbag and when the 
      airbag contacts a foreign object.  Any arrangement of airbags is possible.  Airbags could be
      arranged to protect from impacts on all sides of the body.
  - Aerodynamic surfaces
  - abrasion resistant surfaces with high, low or controllable coefficient of friction
  - wheels with or without brakes
  - powered wheels
  - a camera or cameras mounted for example on the helmet of the suit can be used to monitor 
    joint position.  This joint monitoring system may be used with or without specific visual targets.
  - thrust producing elements including rockets, jets or fans
    - For example rockets could be mounted to the suit.  The rockets may be solid fuel
      rockets with enough fuel so that they can be fired in a direction so that the suit and wearer of
      the suit can be decelereated from the maximum speed expected.  Control fins can be inserted into
      the flow of gas exiting the nozzel by a controlled actuators to direct and control the amount of
      thrust produced, or the thrust producting elements can be gimbal mounted.

# use cases

  - preventing joints of the human body from moving beyond safe limits
  - kinetic energy absorption
    - For example, stick you arms out in front of you while driving towards a concrete wall
      on an electric skateboard.  Friction based joint movement locks in the suit would be modulated
      to maintain a controlled deceleration.  
  - The suit's joints can be locked to create a sort of wearable chair.  This feature may 
    be especially useful on long trips on an electric skateboard with automatic lean control.
    The skateboard driver would lock some or all of the joints on the skateboard and in essence,
    become a rigid or semi-rigid body.  Sensors would monitor the lean angle of the body and an 
    automatic contol system would maintain a desired lean angle.  It's basically an inverted
    pendulum problem.  The driver can directly control the lean angle setpoint with, for example
    a joystick or other layers of control can be applied on top of the lean angle controller.
